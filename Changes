0.07   2008-11-10

- Fixed a bug where class attributes did not honor the
  Class::MOP::Attribute properly, so things that used it directly
  failed. This bug could be tickled by using certain
  MooseX::AttributeHelpers attribute metaclasses with a class
  attribute. Fixed by Shawn Moore.


0.06   2008-09-06

- No code changes, just added a missing prereq for
  MooseX::AttributeHelpers.


0.05   2008-09-05

* Totally rewritten as proper meta classes, so it supports
  introspection and all that good stuff. This breaks some old code
  because there is no longer a "containing class" for class
  attributes.


0.04   2008-01-21

- An internals change to make this class work with Moose 0.34.


0.03   2007-12-08

- Split main functionality out of sugar sub class_has(), into
  process_class_attribute(). This makes it easier to create attributes
  on behalf of other classes.


0.02   2007-11-25

- Inherit from Exporter, rather than trying to import its
  import(). Unfortunately, older Exporters as shipped with Perl 5.6.x
  only allow subclassing.


0.01   2007-11-24

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
