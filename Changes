0.04   2008-01-21

- An internals change to make this class work with Moose 0.34.


0.03   2007-12-08

- Split main functionality out of sugar sub class_has(), into
  process_class_attribute(). This makes it easier to create attributes
  on behalf of other classes.


0.02   2007-11-25

- Inherit from Exporter, rather than trying to import its
  import(). Unfortunately, older Exporters as shipped with Perl 5.6.x
  only allow subclassing.


0.01   2007-11-24

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
